    "Quentin Tarantino is a well-established, acclaimed, and successful director best known for the unique style of his films. Some hallmarks of his films include non-linear storytelling, satire, and pop culture references. Tarantino is also known for employing numerous instances of stylized, graphic violence and an abundance of profanity throughout all of his films and thus they have all garnered “R” ratings. Based on the common theme of swear words and given the success and popularity of his films, our team wondered if there was any correlation between the types of swear words spoken and each film’s success. \n",
    "\n",
    "A previous study of Tarantino’s films has found that the spread of profanity across his movies has not been consistent: over 75% of curse words were found in just three out of seven films studied, and over 90% of cursing in his movies was found in four out of the seven (2). Additionally, Tarantino seems to have a penchant for using various forms of the F-word, as its different forms make up a majority of curse words used in his films (2). The study also found that the types of swear words employed vary in proportion across movies depending on the type of film it was: for instance, while the F-word makes up a majority of curse words uttered in most of Tarantino’s films,  Django Unchained was an exception in that it featured far more racial slurs compared to other types of swearing since it was a period piece about slavery (2). It was also noted that Tarantino’s use of “R-rated” swear words such as the F-word has decreased in recent years, possibly due to increasing mainstream popularity of his films (2).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another study has shown that while the amount of expletives has actually decreased in teen-oriented films over the years, it has increased in teen-oriented television shows (1). In addition, there is a difference in the type of swear words used and how often it is used between genders (1). This led us to explore whether swear words, and specifically what types, in Quentin Tarantino’s movies had an effect on how successfully the film performed.\n",
